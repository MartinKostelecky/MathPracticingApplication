Practicing demo application of basic mathematical operations for elementary school child

Since it is a demo application I want to learn how to build application with microservice architectural design. 

First goal: when finished, the application in MVC architecture will provide randomly selected test questions on frontend. 
User get corresponding (correct/incorrect) message after sending an answer. 
Questions will be stored in database and there will be possibility to add, update or delete questions in admin section of the app.

Second goal: change the architecture to microservices.

Used technologies: Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, HTML
